Similar to the previous exercise, the dependence of time on the number of threads is inversely proportional. Fisrt several runs are much slower, but afterwards there is no big difference in time. Probably because the mutex actions slow the computation with big number of threads. Copmaring to the results of ex3, we can see that for small number of threads the mutex usage makes computation approximately twice faster. On the other hand, the more threads we want to use, the faster program without mutex is (comparing to the same number of threads in using mutex variant).
