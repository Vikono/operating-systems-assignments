Similar to the previous exercise, the dependence of time on the number of threads is inversely proportional(kind of). Fisrt several runs are much slower, but afterwards there is no big difference in time, but it slowly grows again. Probably because the mutex actions slow the computation with big number of threads. Copmaring to the results of ex3, we can see that for small number of threads the mutex usage makes computation approximately the same. With the mutex, the execution time decreases sharply with an increase in the number of threads after first compilation. At the end, execution time of both variants is the same( more or less), so there is no big difference if we use enough number of threads. If we want to use sufficiently small number of threads it is better to use program with the mutex usage to increase efficiency.
