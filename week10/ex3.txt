All rights are represented as 9 bits, they are devided by three groups - each one for user's, group's and others' rights
So, every number in short version is responsible for concrete 'owner' of rights and represent the range of rights. 
660 (110 110 000) means that the user and group can read and write to the file only, but others do not have any rights concerning this file.
775 (111 111 101) means that the user and group have all rights, but others have only read and execute rights.
777 (111 111 111) means that everybody is granted all rights.
